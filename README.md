#### What was your role/which stories did you work on

Diego mostly worked on the database functions of the app. This included creating a user, logging in with an existing user, and deleting a user. The work was not complicated but it was time consuming because of all the cases that had to be addressed incase a user makes a mistake on their part.

- What was the biggest challenge?
  - Creating the database and syncing it up to the user text inputs
- Why was it a challenge?
  - Being new to Expo, React Native, and TypeScript made it challenging to initialize the database and get it running before actually starting to connect it to the screens.
  - How was the challenge addressed?
  - Reading the Expo documentation and using ChatGPT to learn what the errors that were returned meant were good resources
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project?
  - Seeing it all come together after starting off clueless.
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
  - I would go straight to the Expo documentation first instead of watching Youtube tutorials that are outdated.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  - Getting comfortable with working with a team and communicating well is key. Using Git commands was also a good refresher

#### What was your role/which stories did you work on

Kyle mostly worked on the visual functions and a few misc components. For example, the theme context and the ability to change from a light mode to a dark mode across the entire app and the ability to input text for the API to read.

- What was the biggest challenge?
  - Learning a new software environment is never easy. It was a real challenege to learn it under pressure. I think I would have liked more guidance from the outset.
- Why was it a challenge?
  - I think I am so used to focusing narrowly on game programming that it made the structure of a RN app very unintuitive and I continuously made basic errors that cost a lot of time.
- How was the challenge addressed?
  - I spent a lot of time in the first two weeks on issues I couldn't for unknown technical reasons leaving me demoralized. Once I was able to get a better grasp of the project structre as a whole thanks to the help and guidance of my teammates, it was a bit easier to isolated individual problems to solve. That structure and support made all the difference.
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project?
  - It gave me an appreciation for other software environments that provide all the basic functionality out of the box. I think it was a triump that we were able to make it work after struggling quite a bit. I also kind of appreciate the idea of being assigned an impossible task and then overcoming it through cooperation and collaboration. Truely, the real app was the friends we made along the way.
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
  - I would have liked to get a better grasp of the fundamentals earlier by perhaps reading more, prototyping, and especially making sure all of our teammates are on the same page as soon as possible.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  - The notion of a successful solo engineer is a complete myth.
